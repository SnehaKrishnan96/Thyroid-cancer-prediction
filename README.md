# Predicting Whether a Thyroid Nodule is Cancerous using Machine Learning Algorithms
### Early diagnosis of thyroid nodules as cancerous or benign is crucial for effective treatment. Traditionally, this involves a series of medical tests. In this project, we leverage machine learning algorithms to predict the likelihood of a thyroid nodule being cancerous based on patient data such as nodule size, diabetes status, smoking habits, age, and more.
